Discover music: Music discovery made simple. Powered by Spotify


# Getting started




# Goals :

- To make an interface for discovering music based on user selected seeds(like tracks, genre, country, artist)

# Approach:

- Use spotify's /recommendation end point and stepzen backend to utilize spotify's rest endpoint. I used stepzen directives like @rest and @sequence to convert spotify's rest api into graphQl endpoints 

- one of the recommendation seed(country) is determined using ip address of the user. It is done using ip-api


# Functionalities:




- spotify search api to search for music.
- recommend by genre
- recommend by country
- recommend by track

# Outcomes

- react web app to tweak and find music.

# Functionalities
